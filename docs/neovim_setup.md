# Neovim setup

## Recommended installation

To setup Neovim on your machine, it is recommended to download the [custom installer](scripts/nvim_installer.sh) and then run the following command from the folder containing the script:

```bash
bash nvim_installer.sh install
```

You can confirm that Neovim has been properly installed by running `nvim` in a terminal.

## Troubleshooting

If your Operating System is not supported, according to the [compatibility matrix](docs/neovim_compatibility_matrix.md), you can try running `bash nvim_installer.sh install unsupported`.

If you prefer, you can follow the [official Neovim installation instructions](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
